# File-Zipper

FILE ZIPPER PROJECT :

This application allows you to do the following : 
1. Compress your files & download them
2. Uncompress your files & download them
3. Check the compression ratio

To explain the concepts behind encoding and decoding the text , the left section of the project shows the Huffman tree that gets created in the process. 

Try compressing and uncompressing your files on below link  & enjoy watching how each character in the file gets encoded and decoded using the Huffman tree :
